        <p>We carry out research and development projects in collaboration with Danish and international universities, research centres, SMEs, local authorities and other civil society organisations. New energy solutions, improved products, tools for local authorities or energy policy recommendations are some of the outcomes of these projects. Practical expertise and years of tight collaboration with different actors that are making the energy transition happen are our added value as partners of any research project. Furthermore, in all our projects our objective is to make sure that the newly developed knowledge or solutions do not land in a drawer, but reach the right actors or markets.</p>
